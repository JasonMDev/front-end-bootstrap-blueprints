# Bootstrap Site Blueprints

These are my notes from working through the book
[*Bootstrap Site Blueprints*](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/bootstrap-site-blueprints)
by [David Cochran](alittlecode.com)
and published on Feb 2014.

## Synopsis
Without Bootstrap your web designs may not be reaching their full potential. This book will change that through a series of hands-on projects covering everything from custom icon fonts to JavaScript plugins.
