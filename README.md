### About

Since its debut in August 2011, Twitter Bootstrap, now simply Bootstrap, has become by far the most popular framework for empowering and enhancing frontend web design. With Version 3, Bootstrap reaches an exciting new milestone, introducing a mobile-first responsive grid, new and powerful LESS mixins, and a lean code base optimized for modern browsers.

"Bootstrap Site Blueprints" is a hands-on guide to the inner workings of Bootstrap’s latest and greatest development milestone. In an easy-to-follow, step-by-step format, you’ll quickly get to know the ins and outs of Bootstrap while building a portfolio site, a WordPress theme, a business site, an e-commerce interface, and administration interface, and an upscale marketing site.

"Bootstrap Site Blueprints" guides you through the process of building different types of web applications, by leveraging the power of Bootstrap 3. In the process, you’ll experience the power of customizing and recompiling Bootstrap’s LESS files and adapting Bootstrap’s JavaScript plugins, to the design of an excellent user interface. While creating these layouts, you will quickly become comfortable with customizing Bootstrap to meet the needs of your specific projects. You will add custom icon fonts, customize and recompile Bootstrap’s powerful LESS files, and leverage Bootstrap’s excellent JavaScript plugins to create dynamic user interfaces.

By the end of this book you will be a more adept and efficient designer.
